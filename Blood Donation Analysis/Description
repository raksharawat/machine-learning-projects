Data Set Information:

To demonstrate the RFMTC marketing model (a modified version of RFM), this study 
adopted the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City 
in Taiwan. The center passes their blood transfusion service bus to one 
university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. To 
build a FRMTC model, we selected 748 donors at random from the donor database. 
These 748 donor data, each one included R (Recency - months since last 
donation), F (Frequency - total number of donation), M (Monetary - total blood 
donated in c.c.), T (Time - months since first donation), and a binary variable 
representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (1 stand for donating 
blood; 0 stands for not donating blood).
